**React Forms with Hooks**
* React Controlled Vs Uncontrolled ComponentIn a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. 
* The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled component, 
* instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.
